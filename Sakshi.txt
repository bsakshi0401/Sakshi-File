1. What is Git?

Git is a version control system — it helps you track changes in your code, go back to older versions, and collaborate with others.

Think of it like a “time machine” for your code.

🔹 Key Points:

Developed by Linus Torvalds (the creator of Linux).

Keeps track of file changes using commits.

Lets multiple people work on the same project without overwriting each other’s work.

2. What Is GitHub?

GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories online.

It’s where you store your Git projects remotely, share them, and collaborate with others.

3. How Git Works (Workflow)

Let’s understand the 3 main areas:

Working Directory – Where you make changes (actual files).

Staging Area – Where you prepare files to be committed.

Repository (Local Repo) – Where commits are permanently saved.

Then, you can push your changes to the Remote Repository (GitHub).

Flow:

Work → Stage → Commit → Push to GitHub
